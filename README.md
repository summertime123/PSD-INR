In the above figure, features A and B are obtained from images A and B via the RDN encoder, respectively. By orthogonally projecting feature A onto feature B, we can extract the redundant information that is shared between features A and B. Subtracting this projected component from feature A yields the unique information of feature A. As shown, the independence of feature A is significantly enhanced.
